## Alibaba-Inspired Features

### 1. **Multi-Warehouse Management**
Like Alibaba's fulfillment centers:
- Track inventory across multiple locations
- Warehouse-specific stock levels
- Location codes (e.g., A-12-5 = Aisle A, Rack 12, Shelf 5)
- Warehouse filtering and reporting

### 2. **Smart Reorder System**
Automated inventory replenishment:
- **Reorder Point**: When stock hits this level, alert triggers
- **Reorder Quantity**: Optimal order size based on lead time and sales
- **Min/Max Levels**: Safety stock and maximum capacity
- **Days of Stock**: How many days until stockout at current sales rate

### 3. **Stock Status Intelligence**
Automated status calculation:
```typescript
if (availableStock === 0) return 'out_of_stock';
if (availableStock <= reorderPoint) return 'low_stock';
if (availableStock > maxStockLevel) return 'overstock';
return 'in_stock';
```

### 4. **Reserved Stock Management**
E-commerce best practice:
- Stock reserved for pending orders
- Available = Total - Reserved - Damaged
- Prevents overselling
- Automatic release on order cancellation

### 5. **In-Transit Tracking**
Supply chain visibility:
- Track incoming shipments
- Expected delivery dates
- Supplier information
- Anticipate future stock levels

### 6. **Comprehensive Audit Trail**
Full traceability like enterprise systems:
- Every stock movement recorded
- User attribution
- Timestamp tracking
- Reason documentation
- Compliance-ready reporting

## User Interface

### Design Principles:
1. **Information Density**: Maximum data in minimal space
2. **Color Coding**: Quick visual status identification
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile, tablet, desktop optimized
4. **Touch-Friendly**: Large tap targets for warehouse tablets
5. **Fast Actions**: One-click operations for efficiency

### Color Scheme:
- **Green**: Positive actions, in stock, stock in
- **Red**: Critical issues, out of stock, stock out
- **Yellow**: Warnings, low stock, adjustments
- **Blue**: Informational, in transit, neutral actions
- **Purple**: Returns and special cases
