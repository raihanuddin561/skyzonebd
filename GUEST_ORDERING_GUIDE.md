## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Fields

**Product Model:**
```typescript
{
  stock: number;              // Current inventory
  availability: 'in_stock' | 'limited' | 'out_of_stock';
  minOrderQuantity: number;   // MOQ
  maxOrderQuantity: number;   // Max per order
}
```

### Availability Logic

```typescript
function getAvailability(product: Product) {
  if (product.stock === 0) return 'out_of_stock';
  if (product.stock < product.minOrderQuantity * 3) return 'limited';
  return 'in_stock';
}
```

### Cart Validation

```typescript
function canAddToCart(product: Product) {
  return product.availability === 'in_stock' || 
         product.availability === 'limited';
}
```
