## 📊 How It Works

### Price Calculation Flow
```
User Type → Quantity → Calculate Price
    ↓
  GUEST/RETAIL → Retail Price (or Sale Price)
    ↓
  WHOLESALE → Check Quantity
    ↓
  Quantity ≥ MOQ → Wholesale Tier Price
    ↓
  Quantity < MOQ → Retail Price with upgrade suggestion
```

### User Journey

#### B2C Customer:
1. Browse products (see retail prices)
2. Add to cart (any quantity ≥ 1)
3. Checkout with standard payment
4. See wholesale upgrade suggestion

#### B2B Customer:
1. Register with business details
2. Wait for verification (2-3 days)
3. Browse with wholesale prices visible
4. Must meet MOQ for wholesale pricing
5. Can request quotes for large orders
6. Access invoice payment terms
