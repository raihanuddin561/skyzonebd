# Image Upload Functionality Audit Report

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Scope:** Vercel Blob Storage Implementation Across Project

---

## Executive Summary

✅ **Vercel Blob upload functionality is IMPLEMENTED and WORKING**  
⚠️ **Issues Found:** Role check case-sensitivity causing 403 errors  
✅ **Issues Fixed:** All role checks now case-insensitive  
✅ **Best Practice Applied:** Images only upload on form submission (not on file selection)

---

## Implementation Status by Feature

### 1. ✅ Core Upload API (`/api/upload/route.ts`)

**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Purpose:** Single file upload to Vercel Blob

**Features:**
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Admin-only access (now case-insensitive)
- ✅ File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
- ✅ File size validation (5MB max)
- ✅ Uploads to Vercel Blob with `@vercel/blob`
- ✅ Returns public URL
- ✅ DELETE endpoint for cleanup

**Fixed Issues:**
```diff
- if (decoded.role !== 'ADMIN') {
+ if (decoded.role.toUpperCase() !== 'ADMIN') {
```

**API Usage:**
```typescript
POST /api/upload
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: FormData with 'file' and 'folder'
Response: { success: true, data: { url, pathname, contentType, size } }
```

---

### 2. ✅ Multi-Upload API (`/api/upload/multi/route.ts`)

**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Purpose:** Multiple file uploads to Vercel Blob

**Features:**
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Admin-only access (now case-insensitive)
- ✅ Validates each file individually
- ✅ Batch upload to Vercel Blob
- ✅ Returns results per file with error handling
- ✅ DELETE endpoint for batch cleanup

**Fixed Issues:**
```diff
- if (decoded.role !== 'ADMIN') {
+ if (decoded.role.toUpperCase() !== 'ADMIN') {
```

**API Usage:**
```typescript
POST /api/upload/multi
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: FormData with multiple 'files' and 'folder'
Response: { success: true, data: [urls...], errors: [...] }
```

---

### 3. ✅ Utility Functions (`/src/utils/vercelBlob.ts`)

**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED  
**Purpose:** Reusable upload helpers

**Functions Available:**
- ✅ `uploadToBlob(file, options)` - Single file upload
- ✅ `uploadMultipleToBlob(files, options)` - Multiple files
- ✅ `deleteFromBlob(url)` - Delete single file
- ✅ `deleteMultipleFromBlob(urls)` - Delete multiple
- ✅ `replaceInBlob(oldUrl, newFile)` - Replace existing
- ✅ `listBlobFiles(options)` - List files in folder
- ✅ `validateFile(file, options)` - Validate before upload

**Not Currently Used:** These utilities exist but pages use direct API calls instead

---

### 4. ✅ Product Creation (`/admin/products/new/page.tsx`)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED WITH BEST PRACTICES ⭐

**Flow:**
1. User selects image → Preview shown locally (no upload)
2. User fills form data
3. User clicks "Create Product" → Images upload first
4. Product created with uploaded URLs

**Features:**
- ✅ Main image upload (required)
- ✅ Additional images upload (optional)
- ✅ Local image preview using FileReader
- ✅ Images only upload on form submission
- ✅ Sequential upload with progress toast
- ✅ Error handling with user feedback
- ✅ Remove image before submission

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const [mainImageFile, setMainImageFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [additionalImageFiles, setAdditionalImageFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
const [mainImagePreview, setMainImagePreview] = useState<string>('');

// Only uploads when submitting
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  toast.info('Uploading images...');
  const mainImageUrl = await uploadImage(mainImageFile, 'products');
  // ... then create product
};
```

---

### 5. ⚠️ Product Edit (`/admin/products/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED BUT DIFFERENT APPROACH

**Flow:**
1. User selects images → **Uploads immediately** to Vercel Blob
2. Images added to product's image array
3. On save, product updated with new image URLs

**Features:**
- ✅ Uses `/api/upload/multi` endpoint
- ✅ Uploads on file selection (not on submit)
- ✅ Shows upload progress
- ✅ Can delete images
- ✅ Set primary image

**Difference from New Product:**
- Edit page: Uploads immediately on selection
- New product: Uploads only on form submit

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleImageUpload = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setUploading(true);
  // Uploads immediately via /api/upload/multi
  const response = await fetch('/api/upload/multi', {...});
  // Images added to state immediately
};
```

---

### 6. ✅ Category Management (`/admin/categories/page.tsx`)

**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Flow:**
1. User selects image → **Uploads immediately** via `/api/upload`
2. URL stored in form state
3. On save, category created/updated with image URL

**Features:**
- ✅ Single image upload per category
- ✅ Uses `/api/upload` endpoint
- ✅ Upload progress indicator
- ✅ Error handling

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const handleImageUpload = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setUploading(true);
  // Uploads immediately
  const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {...});
  setFormData({ ...formData, imageUrl: result.data.url });
};
```

---

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

**Development (.env.local):**
```bash
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here
```

**Production (Vercel Dashboard):**
- Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables
- Add: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` = your Vercel Blob token

**Get Token:**
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to: Settings → Storage → Blob
3. Create new token with read/write access
4. Copy token to environment variable

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: 403 Forbidden Error ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
```typescript
// Case-sensitive role check
if (decoded.role !== 'ADMIN') {
  return 403;
}
```

If user's role is stored as `'admin'` (lowercase) in database but check expects `'ADMIN'`, upload fails.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Case-insensitive role check
if (decoded.role.toUpperCase() !== 'ADMIN') {
  return 403;
}
```

**Files Fixed:**
- ✅ `/api/upload/route.ts` (POST & DELETE)
- ✅ `/api/upload/multi/route.ts` (POST & DELETE)

---

### Issue 2: Inconsistent Upload Patterns

**Problem:**
- New product page: Uploads on submit ✅ Better UX
- Edit product page: Uploads immediately ⚠️ Can leave orphaned files
- Category page: Uploads immediately ⚠️ Can leave orphaned files

**Recommendation:**
Consider standardizing to "upload on submit" pattern for all forms to prevent orphaned Blob files.

**Benefit:**
- No orphaned files if user cancels
- Better user experience (faster form interaction)
- Single source of truth for image URLs

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Upload on Form Submit (Recommended)

```typescript
const [imageFile, setImageFile] = useState<File | null>(null);
const [imagePreview, setImagePreview] = useState<string>('');

// On file select - just preview
const handleImageChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const file = e.target.files?.[0];
  if (file) {
    setImageFile(file);
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onloadend = () => {
      setImagePreview(reader.result as string);
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  }
};

// On form submit - upload
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  if (!imageFile) return;
  
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', imageFile);
  formData.append('folder', 'products');
  
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
    body: formData,
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  const imageUrl = result.data.url; // Use this URL
};
```

### Example 2: Upload Multiple Files

```typescript
const uploadMultiple = async (files: File[]) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  files.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file));
  formData.append('folder', 'products');
  
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  const response = await fetch('/api/upload/multi', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
    body: formData,
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  const urls = result.data.map(item => item.url);
  return urls;
};
```

### Example 3: Delete Image

```typescript
const deleteImage = async (url: string) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ url }),
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  return result.success;
};
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Standardize Upload Pattern

**Current State:**
- New products: Upload on submit ✅
- Edit products: Upload immediately ⚠️
- Categories: Upload immediately ⚠️

**Recommendation:**
Migrate all forms to "upload on submit" pattern to prevent orphaned files.

### 2. Add Orphaned File Cleanup

**Problem:** If user uploads image but doesn't save form, file remains in Blob storage.

**Solution:** 
- Track temporary uploads in database
- Run cleanup job daily to remove unused files
- Or: Keep immediate upload but track in temp table

### 3. Add Image Optimization

**Current:** Raw images uploaded as-is  
**Better:** 
- Resize/compress before upload
- Generate thumbnails
- Use Next.js Image Optimization

### 4. Add Upload Progress

**Current:** Only toast messages  
**Better:**
- Progress bar for large files
- Show percentage complete
- Allow cancel during upload

### 5. Consider Using Utility Functions

**Current:** Direct API calls in each component  
**Better:** Use existing `vercelBlob.ts` utilities for consistency

---

## Security Checklist

- [x] JWT authentication required
- [x] Admin role verification (case-insensitive)
- [x] File type validation
- [x] File size validation
- [x] HTTPS only (Vercel Blob requires it)
- [x] Public access URLs (intended for product images)
- [ ] Rate limiting (consider adding)
- [ ] Virus scanning (consider for production)

## Vercel Deployment Notes

### Build-time Requirements

**package.json dependencies:**
```json
{
  "@vercel/blob": "^2.0.0"  ✅ Installed
}
```

**Environment Variables (Vercel Dashboard):**
```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN = <your_token>  ⚠️ Must be set in Vercel
DATABASE_URL = <postgres_url>
JWT_SECRET = <secret>
```

### Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Code changes committed to Git
2. ⚠️ Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in Vercel Dashboard
3. ✅ Push to repository (auto-deploy triggers)
4. ⚠️ Test image upload after deployment
5. ⚠️ Verify uploaded images are accessible

---

## Conclusion

### ✅ What's Working

1. **Upload API:** Fully implemented with proper validation
2. **Authentication:** JWT + Admin role check (now case-insensitive)
3. **Product Creation:** Best practice pattern (upload on submit)
4. **Product Edit:** Working but different pattern
5. **Categories:** Working with immediate upload
6. **Error Handling:** Proper error messages and user feedback

### ⚠️ What Needs Attention
