## Next Steps

### 1. API Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
Create API routes for admin operations:

```
src/app/api/admin/
├── products/
│   └── route.ts          # GET (list), POST (create)
│   └── [id]/
│       └── route.ts      # GET, PUT, DELETE
├── orders/
│   └── route.ts          # GET (list)
│   └── [id]/
│       └── route.ts      # GET, PUT (update status)
├── users/
│   └── route.ts          # GET (list)
│   └── [id]/
│       └── route.ts      # GET, PUT, DELETE
└── categories/
    └── route.ts          # GET, POST
    └── [id]/
        └── route.ts      # GET, PUT, DELETE
```

### 2. Create Sub-Pages
- `/dashboard/products/new` - Add product form
- `/dashboard/products/[id]/edit` - Edit product form
- `/dashboard/orders/[id]` - Order details view
- `/dashboard/users/[id]` - User details view

### 3. Database Operations
Update Prisma client calls in API routes:
```typescript
// Example: Get all products
const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
  include: { category: true, wholesaleTiers: true }
});
```

### 4. Image Upload System
Implement Vercel Blob storage for product images:
```typescript
import { put } from '@vercel/blob';

async function uploadImage(file: File) {
  const blob = await put(file.name, file, {
    access: 'public',
  });
  return blob.url;
}
```

### 5. Real-Time Updates
Consider adding:
- WebSocket for real-time order updates
- Notifications for new orders
- Activity feed updates
